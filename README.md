# Network-Anomaly-Detection-using-Autoencoder-and-Random-Forest-Classifier
Designed a network anomaly detection system using Autoencoders and Random Forest. Preprocessed traffic with Scapy and Pandas, applied normalization and trained models to capture normal patterns and detect anomalies. Achieved more than 80% accuracy with real-time visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
